# Mercado Libre NLP Competition Project

## Overview
This repository contains my project submission for an old NLP competition hosted by Mercado Libre, a leading e-commerce company in Latin America. The challenge was to build a multinomial classifier capable of categorizing various products into multiple classes based on their descriptions.

## Problem Statement
The main objective was to accurately classify products into their respective categories using only the textual descriptions provided. This problem falls under the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and involves complex multi-class classification.

## Approach and Techniques
To tackle this challenge, I employed a range of techniques and libraries, including:

- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text processing and linguistic data manipulation.
- **Logistic Regression**: To model the probabilities of different classes.
- **Random Forests**: An ensemble learning method for classification.
- **Stop Words Elimination**: To remove common words that might not contribute to the predictive power of the model.

## Project Structure
